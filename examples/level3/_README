Those are ActionScript 1.0 code examples based mostly upon Sham Bhangal's Flash hacks and
Joey Lott's ActionScript Cookbook. Ruby language is used only as a glue for various AS 1.0
templates and subroutines. The most advanced script: circle.rb consists of 8 parts of code.

Please note, that you have to copy circles.xml, picture.jpg and backyard1.jpg files together with
generated circle.swf and mask.swf files in order to make it work.

Files in catalogue /aa are borrowed from Joey Lott's book.
