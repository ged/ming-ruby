In railsconnection folder there is an example of direct swf output method using rails framework,
index.rhtml should be placed in rails app/view/something folder while cgi script goes to public/swf.
Additionally we have to set following options for Apache:

Listen 8009
<VirtualHost www.alfa.com:8009>
  ServerName rails
  DocumentRoot /var/www/rails/public
  ErrorLog /var/www/rails/log/server.log
  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin /var/www/rails
  <Directory /var/www/rails>
    Options +ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from all
    Order allow,deny
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


Name of the host and port are just arbitrary, important is +ExecCGI option and .cgi file extension
for our ruby script. It works nice for Apache 1 + Ruby 1.8.6 + Ming-0.4beta3, but it should be working
also with other combinations (Apache2, newer Ming's, etc...). This example does not needs mod_ruby.


In midnightcommander folder I've put a MC syntax colorizer file for ruby programming language, with some
Ming objects and methods support. Please note, that this is a work in progress...
